# Medical-Insurance-CodeCademy
Short Portfolio Project through CodeCademy's Machine Learning Fundamentals Path

As part of my progression through my most recent learning Path with CodeCademy, I was invited to build a program to analyze a set of insurance data from a CSV file. This parallels some of the work I did in CS50, which also exposed me to the joys of data analysis with SQL.

For my project, I recreated just a few summary statistics which could be much easier done with SQL in fulfilment of requirements and as a bit of a thought exercise for myself. Here's what I learned:

    > While SQL makes it easy to analyze data, it is *not* easy if you have to code every function yourself -- I am grateful for the SQL tool
    > My original ambition of reinventing the wheel for comparing qualitative and quantitative data were too much -- sometimes you just have to use the right tool (SQL)
    > The UX of a program takes just as long as the actual back-end work, and I was just using command line prompts
    > AI is an incredibly helpful partner for solo projects (more below)

As usual, I made use of ChatGPT while coding this assignment--not to "cheat" and have it write code for me, but as a sort of TA, answering questions not easily found in the Python documentation and to remind me of methodology I may have forgotten. I asked for a refresh on floating-point imprecision in Python and best practices for mitigation, asked for suggestions on ways of ensuring a correct input format (and got turned onto the *re* module which prompted more investigation), and reminded myself about scoping rules to be sure I wasn't making an error mid-design.

In summary, this was another fruitful project and representative of my development on my coding journey. It took me about 4.5 hours in total, and has plenty of opportunity for improvement, just like me!
